# rpi_sunfounder5_config
Configuration for the Sunfounder 5in Display 

**Caution**
Do not edit this configuration in Microsoft Notepad. Doing so will cause your RPi to fail to boot. This is because line termination is handled differently in Notepad. Only edit your configuration with a *nix text editor (Nano, Vi, Vim, Emacs). 

This screen can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Monitor-Display-800X480-Raspberry/dp/B01HXSFIH6/).

This configuration does not enable the use of the touch screen. It will only configure the HDMI output to the mini display. Just copy config.txt to "/boot/".
